This repository is a prototype for a new object oriented streams API, intended for inclusion in the PHP standard library
in PHP 7.

It is *\*not\** intended to be used for anything to write useful code with. The parts that are implemented are only
implemented for testing purposes, to aid in the process of evaluating whether the API makes sense. It is possible that
somewhere down the line this will become a forwards compatibility implementation, but at the moment the code here should
be regarded as highly unstable and essentially useless.

Attempt to use the code in this repository at your peril!
